# Activity Flow Editor

## Goals and Scopes
The Activity Flow Editor is a lightweight reusable Web Component to provide:
1. simple activity-centric representations of [GO-CAMs](http://geneontology.org/go-cam)
2. targeted editing ability (e.g. create an activity and [causally link](https://github.com/oborel/obo-relations) two activities)

Its primary purpose is to be integrated in [Noctua Form](https://github.com/geneontology/simple-annoton-editor) to complete this curation workflow.
